# Capstone_Project

The Topic for our capstone Project is **"Effective Multitask Deep Learning for IoT Malware Detection and Identification Using Behavioral Traffic Analysis".**
We aim to use deep learning techniques to effectively detect and identify malware in IoT devices. It emphasizes the importance of behavioral traffic analysis for this purpose, which could involve analyzing the ways in which IoT devices interact with networks and identifying any unusual or malicious behavior. The project is relevant in the context of IoT security, where protecting connected devices from malware and other threats is a critical concern.
